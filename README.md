                      Project Title : Explainable AI for Cervical Cancer Detection using Histopathological Images 




Dataset used for the project: CAISHI (Size ~ 10 GB)




About dataset:
CAISHI is a dataset containing **2240** cervical histopathological images, of which 1010 are of _**normal**_ cervical glands and 1230 are of cervical adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) i.e. _**abnormal**_.
Images of CAISHI are obtained by endoscopic biopsy sampling method, and then pathological sections are made by H&E staining at Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University.
The images, with a magnification of 100x, are taken by the Axio Scope.A1 microscope. The size of the image is 3840 × 2160 pixels and the format is ".png".

Transfer Learning - Mobile Net V3
Salient features:
1. Hardware-Aware NAS → Lower latency
2. Hard-Swish Activation → More accuracy at nearly zero extra cost
3. SE (Squeeze-and-Excitation) Blocks → Stronger feature quality
4. Inverted Residuals + Depthwise Separable Convolutions → Massive efficiency
5. MobileNetV3 Large vs Small → Precise control over tradeoffs
